# NFTPerp V2 Examples

NFTPerp V2 relies on Trigger order keepers and external liquidators to keep the platform going.

Trigger Order Keepers will receive a constant fee for executing the trigger orders during the right time.

Liquidators will be able to buy a position at a 2.5% discount.

This repo contains scripts from which liquidators and keepers can build to run a better system.


During the launch of NFTPerp V2, we will be running these scripts to guarantee stability. However, with the open-source of these scripts, we expect the free market to take over, and the platform can then maintain its ethos of incentive-based decentralization.
